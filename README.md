1. Debug description for arrows (CustomRepresentable), then replace as appropriate in fatalError calls

Refactor
Lot's of tests
nicest way to get undo operations (use 'undo' idea?)

Rename Node 'Circle'
make waypointNamed methods more concise

// Tests
1. Making sure undo enabled/disabled correctly


2. Something - undo - something - redo ?
3. Removing arrows/unset next
